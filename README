## Overview

This project is a curated set of coding exercises intended to showcase my development skills in Python. Each exercise demonstrates my understanding of concepts such as algorithms, data manipulation and more. The repository is organized with Jupyter Notebooks for interactive exploration and explanation.

## Skills and Topics Covered

- **Data Structures**: Lists, Dictionaries, Sets, and Tuples
- **Algorithms**: Sorting, Searching, Recursion
- **Problem Solving**: Hands-on coding exercises and real-world scenarios

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- `virtualenv` (if needed, install with `pip install virtualenv`)

   git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
   cd repository

### Preparing enviroment

2. **Create and activate a virtual enviroment**:
    ```Linux - Mac | bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    ```Windows | PowerShell
    python -m venv venv
    ./venv/Scripts/activate.ps1

3. **Install dependencies**
    ```Linux - Mac | bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt

    ```Windows | PowerShell
    pip install -r requirements.txt

### Running the notebooks

3. **Run**:
    ```VS Code
